free-food is potluck management software, focused on Indian Food

Indian food is rich and varied. It poses interesting challenges to people organizing a potluck. The primary challenges is around how much quantity to ask participants to get, and coordinating the dishes. Serving the food has its intricacies as well.  This project tries to solve some of these challenges, with a specific focus on organizing large potlucks!
